                  <p>
                    Mie Ride was born in Ontario from a simple belief: travel
                    should connect people, not just destinations. This
                    Ontario-based ride service emerged when two friends
                    confronted the same transportation frustrations you likely
                    face every day. The idea sparked in 2023, after yet another
                    overpriced airport trip and the familiar struggle of
                    downtown parking. What if ride prices could remain
                    consistent regardless of demand? What if drivers and
                    passengers heading the same way could connect, sharing both
                    the journey and the cost?Today, that vision has grown into
                    Ontario's most transparent ride service â€“ where prices stay
                    fixed, communities grow stronger, and every shared journey
                    helps reduce our environmental footprint

                  <p>
                    Life rarely follows a perfectly straight line. Add multiple
                    stops to your journey, schedule return trips in one booking,
                    or modify your plans as needed. Drivers can set availability
                    for up to five cities and choose when they want to work -
                    because we believe transportation should adapt to your life,
                    not the other way around.
